Create a admin interface with gradio for a questionnaire with only yes and no answer.
You should add and remove questions from the questionnaire.
The questionnaire should be saved to a file and loaded from a file (CSV).
Show a list of all questions and the number of yes and no answers.
You should be able to edit the questions and the answers.
You should be able to select a question that should be active (only one question can be active at a time).
Make the admin interface structured and user-friendly.
